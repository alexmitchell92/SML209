Essentially, this subreddit can be seen as the wikipedia of Spanish language learning. It contains a huge amount of links to different resources and is also an excellent place for learners of the language to discuss anything related to their experience learning the language.</span></li>

<h2>Movies/Series</h2>

<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6468322/">La casa de Papel</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Without giving too much away this is a fantastic recent Spanish series that follows a band of criminals that run a heist on Spain's equivalent of the royal mint.</span></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5674718/">Las chicas del cable</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Set in the 1920s, this series is based around the lives of 4 girls working as call operators at a telecommunications company. Apart from fantastic drama, the series is a great insight into the social and cultural norms in Spain at that time.</span></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2955316/">Ochos apellidos vascos</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is a hilarious movie about a relationship between a man from Sevilla and a girl from Pa√≠s vasco. Although the Spanish is difficult, if you have a sufficient level it is definitely worth a watch. The movie perfectly represents the typical stereotypes of the two drastically regions of Spain.</span></li>

<h2>YouTube Channels</h2>

<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LightSpeedSpanish">Lightspeed Spanish</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">A charming YouTube channel ran by Spanish/English couple Cynthia and Gordon. They have a huge selection of classes ranging from absolute beginner to advanced speaker all for free. This channel was key in the early stages of my own language learning journey with Spanish. A personal reccomendation is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h1m6W4ZqgM">Por/Para explanation by Gordon.</a></span></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBpoa34u0KPILxh3Rmbl_Kw">Ambie Gonzalez TV</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Ambie Gonzalez is an American polyglot who speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean and Chinese. She has a lot of lessons on her channel and recently moved to Puerto Rico with her two twin girls which provides a unique peak into one of the less familar Spanish cultures.</span></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6MwGi30pqAmg2djWyksUBA">Zach Morris</a><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">Zach Morris is an American who has lived all over Latin America for around the last 7 years (I believe). His videos are great at highlighting the different characteristics of Latin culture and he is hilarious. In the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMgS9_bEo8Y">video</a> he explains how you can be more Colombian!</span></li>

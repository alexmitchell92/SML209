    As I'm sure you're well aware, South America is not a single country. Rather, it is comprised of 12 countries that mainly speak either Spanish or Portuguese (Brazil). Therefore this page will try to address South America as a whole, rather than just a single country like page dedicated to Spain. 
    
    Please see the below slides for interesting and fun facts about South America!
